<h1>How to create a Python program that counts the number of characters in string</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>We will learn to <a href="https://ittutoria.net/count-occurrences-of-a-character-in-a-string-in-python/">count the occurrences of a character in string in Python</a>. This tutorial will teach you how to use Python to create a program that counts the occurrences of each character in a string. We will identify the distinct characters, distinct characters, unique characters and count the string's words.</p>
<h2>What is the count of occurrences of a character in a string?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take a string (example: "Python Programming") and create an empty dictionary.</li>
<li>Use the strings characters as keys, and their count as values.</li>
<li>If a character is in the string as a key, increment it. Other options include adding the new character as a key to the dictionary and assigning its count value as 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we have a python string dictionary. Let's find out what we can do with this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate characters from the String</li>
<li>Different characters in the string</li>
<li>Unique characters for the String</li>
<li>The string's number of words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: Welcome to the ittutoria.</li>
<li>Please enter the character you wish to count: t</li>
<li>Output: The total number of times t has occurred = 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>Algorithm for counting the occurrences of a character within a string</h2>
<p>Enter a string and the character that you wish to search.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a count variable to 0.</li>
<li>Iterate by using a for loop and check with an if statement if the current and searching characters are equal.</li>
<li>When you get the matching character, increment the count variable.</li>
<li>Print count variable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python program to count the number of characters in a string.</h2>
<pre>
<code>
string = input("Please enter the String : ")
char = input("Please enter the Character you want to count: ")
count = 0
for i in range(len(string)):
    if(string[i] == char):
        count = count + 1
print("The total Number of Times ", char, " has Occurred = " , count)
</code>
</pre>
<p><b>Output:</b></p>
<p>Please enter the String : Welcome to the ittutoria<br>
Please enter the Character you want to count: t<br>
The total Number of Times t has Occurred = 5</p>
